Software Installation steps:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install iverilog

sudo apt-get install gtkwave

Execution steps:

Program 1.

execute the files a.v and atestbench.v as mentioned below
 
    Step1) iverilog -o aout a.v atestbench.v

   If the compilation went OK, you won't see any output. What this does is create a file called  aout that we can feed to the simulator.

    Step2) vvp aout

You can observe output on the console

    Step3) gtkwave dump.vcd

Output waveform will be observed.

Program 2.

execute the files b.v and btestbench.v as mentioned below
 
    Step1) iverilog -o bout b.v btestbench.v

   If the compilation went OK, you won't see any output. What this does is create a file called  simple.vvp that we can feed to the simulator.

    Step2) vvp bout

You can observe output on the console

    Step3) gtkwave dmp1.vcd

Output waveform will be observed
